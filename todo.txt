In no particular order:
Fix boundary wrapping (make the edge cells always dead in nextCellState)  
  Or alternately wrap to connect top/bottom, left/right (cooler, harder)
(Alternate post) Version that dosn't use JQuery for comparison

Shelved:
Add ">" "||" play/pause/resume icons to buttons - no unicode for font, messes up
button heights

Cell color change with age -> e.g. light to dark
      Perhaps store age as a data- value in html, add class for age > 2, age >
      4, etc.  Maybe makes more sense to have array storing cell objects with an
      age property.
