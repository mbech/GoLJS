In no particular order:
1.  Time and Population Counters (text sidebar)
2.  Fix boundary wrapping (make the edge cells always dead in nextCellState)  
3.  (Alternate) Version that dosn't use JQuery for comparison
4.  Add ">" "||" play/pause/resume icons to buttons
5.  Cell color change with age -> e.g. light to dark
      Perhaps store age as a data- value in html, add class for age > 2, age >
      4, etc
